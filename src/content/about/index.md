Hello! I'm Howard, a full-stack developer and freelance photographer. I'm also currently a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa.

I've been programming since 2016, and have several full-stack work experiences where I developed for applications in various technologies. I'm the most proficient in web development, having worked with Vue, React, and Angular for the past few years. I'm also proficient in backend development, working with Java Sling/Spring applications with PostgreSQL/MySQL, as well as Python for data analysis and machine learning, particularly for Generative AI.

I'm also a photographer with over a decade of experience, having started as a hobby in late 2012 and freelance since 2018. I specialize in event photography, particularly for conferences and music festivals, but I also do portrait photography freelance.
